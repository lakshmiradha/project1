                Biography
            </h2>
            <p>
                <span>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi </span>(Mahatma Gandhi) was born on October 2, 1869, into a Hindu Modh family in Porbanadar, Gujarat, India. His father, named Karamchand Gandhi, was the Chief Minister (diwan) of the city of Porbanadar. His mother, named Putlibai, was the fourth wife; the previous three wives died in childbirth. Gandhi was born into the vaishya (business caste). He was 13 years old when married Kasturbai (Ba) Makhanji, through his parents arrangement. They had four sons.<span>Gandhi learned tolerance and non-injury to living beings from an early age.</span> He was abstinent from meat, alcohol, and promiscuity.

                Satyagraha
            </h2>
            <p>
                Gandhi believed that his vow of brahmacharya allowed him the focus to devise the concept of <span>satyagraha</span> in late 1906. In the simplest sense, satyagraha is passive resistance, but Gandhi described it as <span>"truth force"</span> or natural right. He believed exploitation was possible only if the exploited and the exploiter accepted it, so seeing beyond the current situation provided power to change it.

            Independence
           </h2>

           <p>
            Many British parliamentarians realized they were facing mass protests and began discussing an independent India. Although Prime Minister Winston Churchill opposed losing India as a colony, the British announced in March 1941 that it would free India after World War II. Gandhi wanted independence sooner and organized a<span> "Quit India"</span> campaign in 1942. The British again jailed Gandhi.

            Assassination
           </h2>
           <p>
            
           Not everyone approved of the plan. Some radical Hindu groups believed that India shouldn't have been partitioned, blaming Gandhi. On January 30, 1948, the 78-year-old Gandhi spent his day discussing issues. Just past 5 p.m., Gandhi began the walk, supported by two grandnieces, to the Birla House, where he was staying in New Delhi, for a prayer meeting. A crowd surrounded him. A young Hindu named Nathuram <span>Godse</span> stopped before him and bowed. Gandhi bowed back. Godse shot Gandhi three times. Although Gandhi had survived five other assassination attempts, he fell to the ground, dead.
